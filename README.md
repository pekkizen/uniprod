# uniprod

Here are functions for computing and comparing
sample mean values of products on Uniform(0, 1)
random numbers.

Loading prod.R in workspace calls Rcpp/C++ compiler for C++ functions in uniprod.cpp file. R functions implement most of the functionality and C++ functions are not entirely necessary.  

The functions are some what commented in the program code.
